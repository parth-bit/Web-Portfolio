                    <h2>CHAPTER 1- BIRTH 2003</h2>
                    <p>
                        Born on September 2003 in Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh into a joint family of 26 members.
                        I was the naughtest & laziest one in the family. It was a pleasure to born in such a joyful house.
                        I am the most loved kid. I have a young sister too, she is the most irritating creature I ever got.

                    <p>
                        Life is all about ups and downs, Me and my family shifted to Raipur, Chattisgarh. New state, New City, New school made me nervous.
                        But I never gave up. I was in 3rd grade where some subjects are new to me like HINDI.
                        I faced difficulty to understand Hindi but somehow I managed. I became school topper and proved myself that I can face challenges and realised that 
                         <br> " I AM A GOOD LEARNER."

                    <h2>Chapter 3- Interests</h2>
                    <p>
                       I was a student in Adarsh Vidyalaya School and I still remember I was in 9th grade when we were taught about HTML. I was amazed by developing small websites and my teacher even taught how to animate websites.
                        I was so amazed that my interest in web designing and developing started increasing. I begin to learn more and more, developed some websites as well as learned many languages like Python, Java and C.
                        Developed many projects. I somewhere heard about Full-stack Deveopment and then my life took a turn. !!

                    <h2>Chapter 4- College Life</h2>
                    <p>
                        After completing my school, I decided that <br>"I want to become a FULL-STACK DEV" <br>
                        I moved to Bangalore for my Under graduation and took admission in Presidency College. I successfully completed Bachelor's degree in Computer Applications with a outstanding CGPA of 9.0 in 2024 .
                        Surviving in Bangalore is tough, people eat rice thrice a day. I missed home specially when it's a festival because this city has nothing to do in occasions. Still managed to survive and learned a lot from this city.
